Document Structure
==================

Table of contents, Pages and Headings
-------------------------------------

Headings are tricky to manage as they need to be consistent across pages, and form a table of contents structure for the document as a whole.

:file:`index.rst`:

.. code-block:: rst
   
   ########
   Document 
   ########
   
   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2
      :caption: Contents:
  
      section/index

:file:`chapter/index.rst`:

.. code-block:: rst

   *******   
   Chapter
   *******
   
   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2
      :caption: Contents:
  
      page

:file:`chapter/section.txt`:

.. code-block:: rst

   Section
   =======
   
   Heading
   -------
   
   Subheading
   ^^^^^^^^^^
   
   subsubheading
   """""""""""""

.. note:: Technically RST defines heading levels based on the order they appear within a page, however sphinx use of multiple pages to form a larger document and tabel of contents structure dictates consistent use of headings as shown above.

Lists
-----

There are two types of lists, bulleted lists and numbered lists.

Bulleted list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bullet lists are useful for a small number of items, where no order is implied:
   
   Applicable standards:
   
   * iso19139: describing information or resources that have geographic extent
   * iso19110: classification of feature types into a feature catalogue 

.. code-block:: rst

   Applicable standards:
   
   * iso19139: describing information or resources that have geographic extent
   * iso19110: classification of feature types into a feature catalogue 

.. note:: Example Bullet  lists should all be of a consistent style, either short sentence fragments, or full sentences. 
   
   Switch to numbered lists when presenting more than five ideas.

Numbered list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Numbered lists used to define step-by-step instructions or present a larger number of ideas.

   #. Reproject ``roads`` from WGS84 to Web Mercator:
   
      .. code-block:: sql
         
         ALTER TABLE roads
           ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(MULTILINESTRING, 4326)
           USING ST_SetSRID(geom,4326);
   
   #. Efficient use of PostGIS depends on having up to date statistics of table contents for the query planner, and cleaning up unused space after table inserts and deletes:
      
      .. code-block:: sql
         
         VACUUM ANALYZE roads;
   
This is accomplished with the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

   #. Reproject ``roads`` from WGS84 to Web Mercator:
   
      .. code-block:: sql
         
         ALTER TABLE roads
           ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(MULTILINESTRING, 4326)
           USING ST_SetSRID(geom,4326);
   
   #. Efficient use of PostGIS depends on having up to date statistics of table contents for the query planner, and cleaning up unused space after table inserts and deletes:
      
      .. code-block:: sql
         
         VACUUM ANALYZE roads;

.. warning:: Use of `#.` to automatically number steps make it easy to add/remove steps and notice if an indentation mistaken accidentally restarts numbering. Numbering lists using `1.` `2.` and `3.` is not recommended. 

Nested lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Numbered and bulleted lists may be nested:

   #. Choice of spatial reference system for ``SRID``:
      
      * ``4326``: WGS84 popular with geographic professionals and the scientific community used for GPS data.
      * ``3857``: Web mercator using a simplified, spherical, model of the world for performance.
