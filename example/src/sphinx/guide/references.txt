   _example::
   
   This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target.

To use target reference:

.. admonition:: Example

   Reference paragraph, using `example`_ target preceding the text, use :command:`ref` directive to :ref:`supply a label <example>`.

.. code-block:: rst
   
   Reference paragraph, using `example`_ target preceding the text, use :command:`ref` directive to :ref:`supply a label <example>`.

This approach is frequently used to provide a target for headings.

.. admonition:: Example
   
   **References**
   
   Reference heading, using :ref:`reference` target preceding header, can also be used :ref:`to provide a label <reference>`.

.. code-block:: rst

   ...
   
   Reference heading, using :ref:`reference` target preceding header, can also be used :ref:`to provide a label <reference>`.

.. note:: GeoNetwork and GeoServer documents use this approach consistently as the resulting references work even of the section of text is moved to a different file.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name.

.. admonition:: Example
   
   Reference any heading on the page, example `Footnotes`_, however this does not work across files.

.. code-block:: rst
   
   Reference any heading on the page, example `Footnotes`_, however this does not work across files.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as "GeoCat_".

.. admonition:: Example
   
   Vist the `GeoCat`_ website

.. _GeoCat: https://www.geocat.net/

.. code-block:: rst

   Vist the `GeoCat`_ website

   .. _GeoCat: https://www.geocat.net/

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

Citations
---------

.. [11] This is the citation I made, let's make this extremely long so that we can tell that it doesn't follow the normal responsive table stuff.

.. [12] This citation has some ``code blocks`` in it, maybe some **bold** and
       *italics* too. Heck, lets put a link to a meta citation [13]_ too.

.. [13] This citation will have two backlinks.


Here's a reference to the above, [11]_, [12]_ and [13]_ citations.
