Block Directives
================

Block directives follow a clear pattern:

.. code-block:: rst
   
   .. {directive}:: value
      :option: value
      
      directive content

An example is `code-block` directive:

.. code-block:: rst
   
   .. code-block:: bat
      
      cd %GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR%

.. admonition:: Example
   
   .. code-block:: bat
      
      cd %GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR%

Comments
--------

Comments can be added at any point, and have a similar structure to directives:

.. code-block:: rst
   
   .. this is a comment
      
      Any content is ignored

.. Tip: Comment-out a directive

To quickly turn off or hide a directive remove the ``::`` turning it into a comment:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block bat
      
      cd %GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR%

This can be used to hide exercises or notes that our out-of-date.

.. nextslide:: Tip: Troubleshooting python failures

Commenting out sections of the file is the best way to troubleshoot document generation without losing your work!

.. note:: Example Comment out the second half of your document:

   * If the error still exists the problem is in the first half of the document
   * If the error does not exist the problem is in the second half of the document

Some low-level python failures when generating references and slides can be challenging to troubleshoot. Most directives will produce a clear error message. 

List-tables
-----------

Bulleted lists can sometimes be cumbersome and hard to follow.  When dealing with a long list of items, use list-tables.  For example, to talk about a list of options, create a table that looks like this:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :width: 100%
   :stub-columns: 1
   
   * - Show All
     - check box selected
   * - Name
     - :kbd:`basemap`
    
This is done with the following code:

.. code-block:: rst

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :width: 100%
     :stub-columns: 1
 
     * - Show All
       - check box selected
     * - Name
       - :kbd:`basemap`

.. note:: RST provides a number of other table formatting ideas, :command:`list-table` above is recommended as the easiest to maintain.

Admonition directives
---------------------

A wide range of "admonition" boxes are available, usually only `note` and `warning` directives are styled distinctly.

Note directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note directives have a distinct visual appearance, and can be used to supply additional detail.


.. nextslide::  Note directive: slides

When generating slides notes are shown in the presenters console. Occasionally this is useful to document a difficult discussion topic:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. note::
  
      We will not be discussing the REST interface in this workbook, but you can read more about the :geoserver:`GeoServer REST interface <rest>`.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. note::
  
      We will not be discussing the REST interface in this workbook, but you can read more about the :geoserver:`GeoServer REST interface <rest>`.

.. nextslide::  Note directive: instructor

Training materials use the note directive frequently to leave notes for instructors as shown below.

.. code-block:: rst
   
   .. only:: instructor
      
      .. note:: *Instructor*: These exercises represent the minimal participation expected of an attendee:

.. admonition:: Example

   .. only:: instructor
      
      .. note:: *Instructor*: These exercises represent the minimal participation expected of an attendee:
      
Warning directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We do not use warnings often, use when caution is required.


   .. note:: *Instructor*: These exercises represent the minimal participation expected of an attendee:

.. nextslide:: warning


Admonition directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use ``admonition`` directives frequently, to provide a title for our exericse, explore and challenge activities.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. admonition:: Exercise
   
      Download and install GeoServer Enterprise and data directory.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. admonition:: Exercise
   
      Download and install GeoServer Enterprise and data directory.


Images & Figures
----------------

Figure directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using :file:`svg` graphics we use ``*`` wildcard to provide both a :file:`svg` and :file:`png` image.

.. code-block:: rst
   
  * Editing **data directory** configuration files by hand and reloading *(not usually recommended)*.
  
    .. figure:: /figure/geoserver_data_directory.*
     
       GeoServer data directory

.. admonition:: Example

   * Editing **data directory** configuration files by hand and reloading *(not usually recommended)*.
 
     .. figure:: /figure/geoserver_data_directory.*
    
        GeoServer data directory

The use of :file:`/figure` is relative to :file:`conf.py`, we often export out a single directory of diagrams for an entire document.

.. nextslide:: Figure directive screen snaps

.. code-block:: rst

.. figure:: img/example.jpg
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:


Use `figwidth` to control based on line width, rather than scale which is based on original size.

.. figure:: img/example.jpg
   :figwidth: 80%
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:



Images
^^^^^^

An image example:

.. image:: img/example.jpg


Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph, with the indenting to indicate the literal contents.

Example:

.. code-block:: rst
   
   Command:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      % ls --help
   
   Output::

     usage: ls [-@ABCFGHLOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1%] [file ...]

.. admonition:: Example
   
   Command: 
   
   .. code-block:: bash
  
      % ls --help
  
   Output::

     usage: ls [-@ABCFGHLOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1%] [file ...]

.. nextslide:: default highlighting

Literal blocks a "default" syntax highlighting and are almost exclusively used for command output as shown in the example above.

:file:`conf.py` configuration:

.. code-block:: python
   
   # The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
   pygments_style = None

:file:`theme.conf` default:
  
.. code-block:: python

   pygments_style = tango

.. ifnotslides::
   
   Reference: :sphinx:`Literal blocks <usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#literal-blocks>`

Code Block
----------

Strongly prefer the use of ``code-block`` for syntax highlighting.

Example:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: xml
   
      <Context docBase="geoserver.war">
        <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\data" override="false"/>
        <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_REQUIRE_FILE"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\data\global.xml" override="false"/>
        <Parameter name="GEOWEBCACHE_CACHE_DIR"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\tilecache" override="false"/>
      </Context>

.. admonition:: Example

   .. code-block:: xml
   
      <Context docBase="geoserver.war">
        <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\data" override="false"/>
        <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_REQUIRE_FILE"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\data\global.xml" override="false"/>
        <Parameter name="GEOWEBCACHE_CACHE_DIR"
                   value="C:\ProgramData\GeoServer\tilecache" override="false"/>
      </Context>

Parsed literal:

.. parsed-literal::

    # parsed-literal test
    curl -O http://someurl/release-|version|.tar-gz

Captions:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: Code Blocks can have captions.

    {
    "windows": [
        {
        "panes": [
            {
            "shell_command": [
                "echo 'did you know'",
                "echo 'you can inline'"
            ]
            },
            {
            "shell_command": "echo 'single commands'"
            },
            "echo 'for panes'"
        ],
        "window_name": "long form"
        }
    ],
    "session_name": "shorthands"
    }

CSS code also looks good

.. code-block:: CSS

    /* sidebar in content */
    .rst-content .sidebar .sidebar-title {
      display: block;
      font-family: 'Roboto', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      font-weight: 700;
      background: #f6f8fa;
      padding: 12px 24px 0 24px;
      margin: -24px -24px 24px;
      font-size: 100%;
    }
    .rst-content .sidebar {
      float: right;
      width: 40%;
      display: block;
      margin: 0 0 24px 24px;
      padding: 24px;
      background: #f6f8fa;
      border: 0;
      border-radius: 3px;
    }

Emphasized lines with line numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,5

   def some_function():
       interesting = False
       print 'This line is highlighted.'
       print 'This one is not...'
       print '...but this one is.'

This is done with the following code::

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 3,5

      def some_function():
         interesting = False
         print 'This line is highlighted.'
         print 'This one is not...'
         print '...but this one is.'

Block quote
-----------

Block quotes:
   
.. code-block:: rst

   >> Great idea!
   >
   > Why didn't I think of that?

.. admonition:: Example


   >> Great idea!
   >
   > Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

You can use line blocks, but block quotes are easier.

.. code-block:: rst

   | This is a line block. It ends with a blank line.
   |     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
   |     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
   | Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
     they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
   |     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
     the left edge of the text above it.

   | This is a second line block.
   |
   | Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

.. admonition:: Example

   | This is a line block. It ends with a blank line.
   |     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
   |     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
   | Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
     they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
   |     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
     the left edge of the text above it.

   | This is a second line block.
   |
   | Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Block Quotes (Indentation)
--------------------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Accidentially getting indentation wrong is a common mistake.

Sidebar
-------

.. sidebar:: Sidebar title

    The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power.

    .. image:: img/example.jpg

The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power,
which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character,
and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven.
Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.
Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.
Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.

The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action
on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong,
creative action of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage,
of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.
